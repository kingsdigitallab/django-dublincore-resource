# Django Dublin Core Resource

A Django model and admin interface to manage metadata about your resources
using [standard Dublin Core (DC) schema](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/).

The approach taken by this app is to centralise all your resource metadata
into a single table.

Most DC elements accepts only a single value to keep things simple.
